# Hey, I'm Rohit 👾

## 🚧 What I’m Crafting
- Piecing together clean, efficient TypeScript to build a functional web application
- Pushing boundaries with patterns in Next.js

## 🛠️ Tools I Use
- Code, coffee, and the occasional bug 🐛
- Building systems that understand each other

## 🌱 Constantly Unlearning
- Letting go of what I thought I knew, one refactor at a time

## 🧩 An Idea
- Sometimes, the answer is hiding inside an edge case
